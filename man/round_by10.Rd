\title{Round to nearest power of 10}
\usage{
round_by10(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector to be rounded. Must contain positive values only
(log10 is undefined for 0/negative values).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as x with values rounded to the nearest
power of ten. Returns NaN for invalid inputs (zero/negative values).
}
\description{
This function rounds a numeric value to the nearest power of ten based on its magnitude.
For example, 123 rounds to 100, 456 rounds to 500, and 0.123 rounds to 0.1.
}
\note{
This is different from standard rounding functions (e.g., round() which rounds
to decimal places). Values exactly halfway between powers of ten (e.g., 5, 50, 500)
will round up to the next power (e.g., 5 -> 10, 500 -> 1000). Function will return
NaN and warn for zero/negative inputs.
}
\examples{
round_by10(123) # Returns 100
round_by10(456) # Returns 500
round_by10(0.123) # Returns 0.1
round_by10(c(15, 1500, 0.015)) # Returns c(10, 2000, 0.01)
